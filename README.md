# ArraySwapper
A NASM x86 assembly program that creates and displays an array of elements and allows you to switch elements' positions with others (as many times as you'd like to).

This works by creating an array with values [1, 8], then randomly initializing their positions in the array, displaying each element as a tower (that is as many lines tall as its value), and finally swapping two elements' positions if specified by the user.

To run this program, all you need to do is run the executable script "fproj" in a linux environment.

The input instructions are specified during runtime.

The makefile as well as all the components and source code necessary have also been provided.
